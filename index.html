      <section class="text">
        <p>I was born and raised in La Paz, Bolivia and I did my undergraduate at Emporia State University, where I had the opportunity to intern with the local radio KVOE and produced their first Spanish news program. The radio became the first bilingual news media across east-central and northeast Kansas.  </p>

        <p>My beat is on immigration and community reporting and I love storytelling in different platforms like audio, video and print. I also did investigative journalism, which earned me Second Place in Investigative/ In-Depth news writing by the Kansas Collegiate Media in 2022 for collaborative work with Report for America.
 </p>

        <p>Currently, I am doing my master's in bilingual journalism at the Craig Newmark School of Journalism at CUNY and I am covering the Hispanic/Latine community in the South Bronx. </p>

            <p>An investigative series of how universities in the Midwest handled food insecurity post-pandemic. Through open records, we dive into the system of 18 universities to know what they were doing to combat food insecurity on their campuses, if the cost of attendance was fair given the resources provided by the institutions, and how students felt about it.

            <p>One of the highlights of my journalistic career was producing the first Spanish news program on the local Radio of the city of Emporia, which gave space to different organizations that were already trying to make the city a bilingual one. Emporia Spanish Speakers is an organization that thrives for it. </p>

            <p>On the audio side, I love doing podcasts and actually, that is the way I started doing journalism and storytelling. ESUnited Podcast is a project created alongside the Office of Diversity Student Programs at Emporia State University to give students a space to talk about diversity and inclusion and why is important that universities have more space to focus on it. </p>
